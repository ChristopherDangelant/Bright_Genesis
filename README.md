# Bright_Genesis
My first of many repositories on Github.
My name is Christopher D'Angelantonio and I aspire to become a cybersecurity analyst in my future career.
I am currently knowledgable in regards to the following programming languages: Python, Linux, SQL and R, but I hope to further cultivate my coding expertise via Google Certification courses as well as through leveraging the dynamic utilities of the Github IDE platform. Thus, this repository will list many of my ongoing coding projects and it will contain details pertaining to these projects as well.
Personally, I recently grauduated from SNHU with honors and earned a BS in Data Analytics, for which I plan to go far and accompish much more in my future career in data or computer science.

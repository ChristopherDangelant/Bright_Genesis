Cybersecurity Incident Report: 
Network Traffic Analysis

Network Traffic Analysis:
The UDP protocol reveals that: the observations made after applying the tcpdump or packet sniffer to the UDP packet requests, which were initially utilized in conjunction with the DNS protocol in order to relay to the DNS server of yummyrecipesforme.com to obtain the destination IP address of its website domain, had reflected that the DNS port named port 53 was deemed unreachable according to the ICMP network traffic logs. Explanatorily,  these UDP requests were initially relayed from our client customer browsers to the DNS server of yummyrecipesforme.com and the package contents stored within any UDP messages are reflected within the first and second line of its subsequent log documentation. Furthermore, the ICMP error response generated from the UDP requests denied by the DNS server and relayed back to the source browser were shown in the lines following the first two of the log events contained within the error message, which read “udp port 53 unreachable”. Articulately, these event logs were generated and returned to the source IP address of the client customer browsers of users that sent the UDP requests, as a response to being ignored while attempting to retrieve the destination IP address for the DNS server of yummyrecipesforme.com via port 53.

Given that port 53 is responsible for facilitating DNS-based services and the UDP requests returned within the ICMP data packets containing the error message stating “udp port 53 unreachable”, it would suggest that this issue stems from within the DNS server of the yummyrecipeforme.com website. Moreover, suspicions regarding problematic DNS protocol processes were further reinforced by an indicative plus sign displayed behind the query ID number “35084” within the initial UDP messages sent along with the capital letter  “A”, which suggests that complications existed in regards to carrying out DNS protocol procedures. Therefore, my premise is there is a high probability that the DNS server facilitated by port 53 is failing to efficiently respond, especially when considering the faulty implications derived from the initial UDP message and DNS response or ICMP log retrieved. 

In order to effectively render the yummyrecipeforme.com webpage, the customer's browser has to relay a successful query to the corresponding DNS server associated with port 53 through utilizing the UDP protocol to retrieve its domain name, which is essentially a integral part of the procedure of the DNS protocol. Specifically, the analytical results of the tcpdump packet sniffer had reflected, that upon relaying UDP requests to the DNS-oriented port 53, its return packet failed to include the requested destination IP address of the domain name for yummyrecipesforme.com webpage, but instead it contained an error message such as the following: " UDP port 53 unreachable."

This is based on the results of the network analysis, which show that the ICMP echo reply returned the following error messages as per each UDP data packet request::

ICMP 203.0.113.2 udp port 53 unreachable length 150
ICMP 203.0.113.2 udp port 53 unreachable length 254
ICMP 203.0.113.2 udp port 53 unreachable length 320

The port noted in the error message is used for: 

Facilitating DNS services linked to relative destination IP requests and UDP data packet transmissions. 

The most likely issue is: Given the nature of the unreachable port issue pertaining to DNS-based port 53, it would suggest that there may be complications present within the associated DNS server of yummyrecipesforme.com as well as potential problems with their associative network or firewall configurations. Thus, this may further suggest that this problem could be linked to a potential security threat, DOS or DDOS attack being aimed against their yummyrecipeforme.com’s relative DNS server, which is facilitated through use of port 53.


Incident Report:
These series of failed UDP packet requests to retrieve the destination IP address from the DNS server for yummyrecipeforme.com, for which its destination was port 53 occurred approximately between the time of 1:24-1:28 p.m., according to the 24-hour formatted timestamps included in the ICMP network traffic logs generated within the tcpdump packet analyzer analysis.  

The IT team was made aware of this failed data request and potential security compromisation in the mid-afternoon around 1:30 p.m, when numerous customers of clients reported having issues with gaining access to the client website named yummyrecipesforme.com, since they stated that they would receive port 53 unreachable error messages upon waiting for the web page to load. Thus, the IT team quickly responded to these client reports by applying tests via the tcpdump packet sniffer in order to gain more details regarding the status of this data request problem. Furthermore, me and their IT team are diligently working on pinpointing the root issue provoking these failed UDP requests to port 53, for which was deemed unreachable within their associative timestamps in order to restore client transmission or IP destination access with the DNS server of the yummyrecipeforme.com website.

As a response, me and the IT team of the client servicing company plan to conduct troubleshooting and security diagnostics of the DNS server as well as associative firewall configurations, since it may be causing port 53 of yummyrecipesforme.com domain server to be blocked, which would explain the error messages returned to hosts within the ICMP packets that were analyzed by our tcpdump packet sniffer. Given the nature of this client reported issue, we believe that it is possible that the domain server could have fallen victim to a DOS or DDOS attack, which could have flooded their network device and as a result, shut down the DNS services associated with port 53. Ultimately, the DNS server could have been shut down via receiving an intentional flood of network traffic or server administrator might have made alterations to relative firewall configurations, which could have disabled port 53.
